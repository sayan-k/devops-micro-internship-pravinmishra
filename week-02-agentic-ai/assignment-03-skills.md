# Assignment 3 — Building Your Command Center

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a local Claude Skills system by creating the `.claude/skills/` folder structure, adding predefined skill files, and executing a real agentic command (`/scaffold-terraform`) to generate infrastructure code. You will also observe how skills enforce tool restrictions and enable controlled automation.
